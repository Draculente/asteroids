        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Asteroids, a web-based game developed as a part of the Web and Cloud Computing Project in
            the year 2023 at the Technical University of Lübeck.</p>

        <p>Game Objective: Asteroids is a classic arcade-style space shooter game where the player controls a spaceship
            and
            navigates through a dangerous asteroid field. The objective is to survive as long as possible by shooting
            down and
            avoiding collisions with the incoming asteroids.</p>

        <p>Technologies Used: The development of Asteroids involved a combination of multiple programming languages and
            frameworks
            to create a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Backend: Python - Python was utilized for the game's backend, ensuring efficient handling of various
                game-related
                functions and operations.</li>
            <li>Game Logic: Rust (WebAssembly) - The game logic was implemented in Rust using WebAssembly, enabling
                high-performance
                execution of the game mechanics and operations.</li>
            <li>View and API integration: Typescript - The game's user interface and API integration were implemented
                using Typescript,
                providing an interactive and responsive front-end experience.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
            <p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
                development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
                efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
                open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
                with others.</p>

            <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
